# PowerShell Network Share Tools

This repository provides a collection of PowerShell functions that assist administrators in managing and evaluating network share permissions, Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACLs), and ownership details.

## Functions

2. `Get-CriticalPermissionOverview`: Get an overview which users have critical permissions on the share
3. `Get-CriticalPermissionsByUser`: Get file and folder objects a user has critical permissions to
4. `Get-FileDACL`: Fetches the DACL of a specified file, returning each Access Control Entry (ACE) as an individual object.
